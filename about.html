Currently a senior from Boling Class (Honor Program) of Physics in Nankai University, with 1-year research experience on topological quantum system and topological quantum computation. 

My research interests include discovering new topological condensed matter systems based on understanding of the topology theory in physics, and learning mathematics and bridging it with physics systems.

Dec. 2017 – present: Undergraduate research fellow, Chern Institute of Mathematics (CIM), Nankai University, China. (Advisor: Prof. Molin Ge)

- Research on Berry phase at degeneracy point for spin-1 in rotating magnetic field. 

July 2018 – Oct. 2018: Undergraduate research fellow, Yeshiva University, USA. (Advisor: Prof. Emil Prodan)

- Studied index theorem and K-theory.
- Did research on braiding Majorana excitations in a lattice using magnetic tube fluxes.
