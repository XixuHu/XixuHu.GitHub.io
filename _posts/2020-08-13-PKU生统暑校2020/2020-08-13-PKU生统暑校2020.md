## Course II.  Stochastic Epidemic Models with Inference

`Example` Reed-Forest epidemic model

- 1 index case (externally infected), the rest $n-1$ susceptible 
- Anyone who gets infected infects other susceptibles independently with prob $p$ and then recovers
- A recovered individual plays no further role in epidemic

Now consider $n=3, p=0.2$ ,please calculate the prob for $Z=1,2$ 

> For $Z=1$ , choose 1 within the 2 to infect $\dbinom{2}{1}p(1-p)$
>
> For the new infected one, it will not infect in the next step $(1-p)$ 
>
> $\Rightarrow$ the overall prob $\dbinom{2}{1}p(1-p)\cdot (1-p)$ 

> For $Z=2$ , one can choose 1 within the 2 to infect $\dbinom{2}{1}p(1-p)$ 
>
> For the new infected one, it infects in the next step $p$ 
>
> Or one can infect the two in the first step with prob $p^2$ 
>
> $\Rightarrow$ the overall prob is $\dbinom{2}{1}p(1-p)\cdot p+p^2$
