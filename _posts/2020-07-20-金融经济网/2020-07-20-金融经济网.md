[TOC]

$g$ 可以表示邻接矩阵，也可以表示权重矩阵  

Geodesic: a shortest path between two nodes    

Matrix $g$  : number of walks of length 1 from $i$ to $j$      

$g^2$ : number of walks of length 2 from $i$ to $j$       

$(N, g)$ is **connected**: there is a link between **every** two nodes (we don’t ask for direct bipartite links)      

Component: <u>maximal</u> <u>connected</u> subgraph; it is connected, and it needs to include all the related nodes in the “bigger graph” ; single node is a component       

######  Diameter& Average path length

- How close are nodes
- How long does it take to reach average node
- How fast will information spread

Diameter: count links, not nodes           

记树的根结点为水平$0$ ，则一棵完全树到第$K$ 水平一共有$2^0+2^1+\cdots+2^K$ 个节点 (化简之后为$\frac{1\cdot (1-2^{K+1})}{1-2}=2^{K+1}-1$ 个节点)，反解得$K=\log_2(n+1)-1$ 。由于直径是最长的geodesic，即第$K$ 水平最左节点到最右节点之间的最短路径，为沿着树枝通过根结点的路径，从最左叶子到根结点的路径长度为$K$ ，所以直径为$2K$       

循环图的直径为两个节点之间最长的最短距离，为$\frac{n}{2}$ 或 $\frac{n-1}{2}$                                 

Erdos-Renyi Graph: serve as a benchmark $G(n,p)$     

- Links are dense so that the network is connected almost surely                  
  $$
  d(n) \geq(1+\varepsilon) \log (n)
  $$

- At the same time, network is not too complete         
  $$
  d(n)/n\to 0
  $$
  

`Thm:` 

> 如果满足上述两个条件，那么对于足够大的$n$ ,平均路径长度除以直径近似与$\log(n)/\log(d)$ 成正比。

Probability of degrees: based on Chernoff bound     

`Probability that node has degree close to average: `          

$$
\operatorname{Pr}\left(\mathrm{d} / 3 \leq \mathrm{d}_{\mathrm{i}} \leq 3 \mathrm{d}\right) \geq 1-\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{d}}
$$

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(\mathrm{d} / 3 \leq \text { all degrees } \leq 3 \mathrm{d}) \geq\left(1-\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{d}}\right)^{\mathrm{n}}
$$


Distribution of links per node: **Fat tails** 

###### Scale Free Distribution


$$
P(d)=c d^{-a}
$$


###### Clustering

用$N_i(g)$ 表示网络$g$ 中节点$i$ 的邻居，则聚类定义为


$$
\mathrm{Cl}_{\mathrm{i}}(\mathrm{g})=\#\left\{\mathrm{kj} \text { in } \mathrm{g} \mid \mathrm{k}, \mathrm{j} \text { in } \mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{i}}(\mathrm{g})\right\} / \#\left\{\mathrm{kj} \mid \mathrm{k}, \mathrm{j} \text { in } \mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{i}}(\mathrm{g})\right\}
$$


*“ What fraction of my friends are friends of each other? ”*       

Overall clustering:    

​      
$$
\mathrm{Cl}(\mathrm{g})=\Sigma_{i} \#\left\{\mathrm{kj} \text { in } \mathrm{g} \mid \mathrm{k}, \mathrm{j} \text { in } \mathrm{N}_{i}(\mathrm{g})\right\} / \Sigma_{i} \#\left\{\mathrm{kj} \mid \mathrm{k}, \mathrm{j} \text { in } \mathrm{N}_{i}(\mathrm{g}) \right\}
$$


Many observed social networks are more clustered than world arise at random          

$n$ 个节点能形成多少种网络(不考虑有向无向，只考虑边)      

$n$ 个节点之间有 $n(n-1)/2$ 条边， 每条边都可能存在或不存在，所以有$2^{\wedge}(n(n-1) / 2)$ 种不同的网络结构      

Define a network’s complement $(N,g')$ : $(ij\in g')$ if and only if $(ij \not\in g)$     

- If a network is connected and not complete, than its complement is nonempty;

- The complement of of a complete network is an empty network, which is not connected

- There is a network such that both itself and its complement are connected:

  Consider $N=\{1,2,3,4\}$ , $g=\{12,23,34\}$ $g'=\{13,24,14\}$              



**Degree centrality**: $\frac{\text{Degree}}{n-1}$ (rememeber to minus 1!)           



Four different things to measure:

- Degree-connect
- Closeness, Decay -easeof reaching other nodes
- Betweenness-role as an intermediary, connector
- Influence, Prestige, Eigenvectors-who you knows 



**Closeness centrality**: $\frac{(n-1)}{\sum_{j} \text{I}(i, j)}$ , $I(i,j)$ **means the shortest path between node $i$ and node $j$**                    

Closeness centrality represents the relative distance to other nodes , and it is scaled directly with distance: twice as far means half as central        

​      

**Decay centrality** : $C_{i}^{d}(g)=\sum_{j \neq i} \delta^{\text{I}(i, j)}$    

 When $\delta$ nears 1, it becomes component size; when $\delta$ nears 0, it becomes degree  centrality; $\delta$ in between 0 and 1 represents a decaying distance measure: weights distance exponentially            

Normalized decay centrality: $C_{i}^{d}(g)=\sum_{j \neq i} \delta^{\text{I}(i, j)} /((n-1) \delta)$ , $(n-1)\delta$ is the lowest decay possible (since $\delta\in[0,1]$ ,$\delta^n<\delta$, I think it is the possible highest decay?)         

​    

**Betweenness centrality** : $\frac{\Sigma_{\mathrm{i}, j \neq k}\left[\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{k}}(\mathrm{i}, \mathrm{j}) / \mathrm{P}(\mathrm{i}, \mathrm{j})\right]}{[(\mathrm{n}-1)(\mathrm{n}-2) / 2]}  $     

$P(i,j)$ :number of geodesic between $i$ and $j$          

$P_k(i,j)$ :number of geodesic between $i$ and $j$ that $k$ lies on         



**Eigenvector centrality** : $C_i=a\sum_{\text{j}}g_{ij}C_j$ , $g_{ij}=\text{I}(j\in N_{i}(g))$                 (A self-referential concept)

  Matrix form: $C=agC$ $\Rightarrow$ eigenvector                

  Use eigenvector centrality, one can distinguishes more “influential” nodes            

  Google page rank: score of a page is proportional to the sum of the scores of pages linked to it         



**Bonacich centrality** : $C^{b}(g)=a g\textbf{1}+b g a g\textbf{1}+b^{2} g^{2} a g\textbf{1}+ \ldots$        

1. give each node a base value $a\cdot d_i(g)$ (const times degree, $a>0$ )             
2. add in all paths of length 1 from i to some j times $b$ times j’s base value
3. add in all walks of length 2 from i to some j times $b^2$ times j’s base value                  
4. ......      



**Diffusion centrality** : $\text{DC}_i(p,T)$ the number of nodes are informed after T periods if node $i$ is initially informed and each informed node has prob $p$ to tell each of its neighbors in each period          

$\mathrm{DC}(\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{T})=\sum_{\mathrm{t}=1 \ldots \mathrm{T}} (\mathrm{pg})^{\mathrm{t}} \textbf{1}$            

- If $p<1 / \lambda_{1}$ and $T$ is large, it becomes Bonacich centrality      
- If $p>1 / \lambda_{1}$ and $T$ is large, it becomes eigenvector centrality            



##### Random Network  

Monotone properties: A property $A(N)$ is monotone, if $g$ is in $A(N)$ and $g$ subset $g'$ implies $g'$ in $A(N)$       

Limiting properties: In order to deduce things about random networks, we often look at large networks, by examing limits         

Threshold function: $t(n)$ is a threshold function for a monotone property $A(N)$     

- If $\frac{p(n)}{t(n)}\to\infty$ , $P(A(N)\mid p(n)) \to 1$   
- If $\frac{p(n)}{t(n)}\to0$ , $P(A(N)\mid p(n)) \to 0$      

We say that a phrase transition occurs at $t(n)$        

`Example-Threshold for random networks:`            

1.  $\frac{1}{n^2}$ -the network has some links (average degree $\frac{1}{n}$)      
2. $\frac{1}{n^{\frac{3}{2}}}$ -the network has a component with at least three links    
3. $\frac{1}{n}$ -the network has a cycle, the network has a unique giant component, a component with at least $n^a$ ($a<1$) nodes (average degree 1)          
4. $\frac{\log(n)}{n}$ -the network is connected (average degree $\log(n)$)

###### Growing Random Networks    

​                                          <font color="#dd0000">“Natural way of varying degree distributions”</font> 

Each date a new node is born, it forms $m$ links to existing nodes and each node is chosen with equal likelihood             

Steps:   

- Start with $m$ nodes fully connected       
- New node forms $m$ links to existing nodes      
- An existing node has a probability $\frac{m}{t}$ of getting new link each period    

Expected degree for node $i$ born at $m<i<t$ is $m+\frac{m}{i+1}+\frac{m}{i+2}+\cdots+\frac{m}{t}\approx m(1+\log(\frac{t}{i}))$              

Nodes that have expected degree less than $d$ at time $t$ are $i>t e^{1-\frac{d}{m}}$        



$$
F_t(d)=\frac{t-t e^{1-\frac{d}{m}}}{t}=1-e^{1-\frac{d}{m}}
$$



$\Rightarrow$ Distribution of expected degree is such that $d-m$ is exponentially distributed with mean $m$ $F(d)=1-e^{-\lambda d}=1-e^{-\frac{d-m}{m}}$ , treat $\lambda=\frac{1}{m}$ and then you can see the distribution        

At time $t$ ,  $t*m$ links are formed, and there are $2*t*m$ total degrees. (cuz each link is counted twice in total degree)             



###### Mean field approximations

Continuous time approcimation: 



$$
d_i(i)=m\qquad(\text{Starting condition})\\
\frac{dd_i(t)}{dt}=\frac{m}{t}\qquad (\text{New links gained per unit time})
$$



$\Rightarrow$ $d_i(t)=m+m\log(\frac{t}{i})$              



###### Preferential attachment

Power law explanantion: Rich get richer- growth of existing object is proportional to size         

“Forms links with probability proportional to number of links a node already has”, probability attaching to $i$ is $\frac{d_i(t)}{2mt}$          

​         

$$
d_i(i)=m\qquad(\text{Starting condition})\\
\frac{dd_i(t)}{dt}=m\cdot \frac{d_i(t)}{2mt}=\frac{d_i(t)}{2t}\qquad (\text{New links gained per unit time})
$$



$\Rightarrow d_i(t)=m\sqrt{\frac{t}{i}}$   



Nodes that have expected degree less than $d$ at time $t$ are $i>t (\frac{m}{d})^2$        



$$
F_t(d)=\frac{t-t(\frac{m}{d})^2}{t}=1-(\frac{m}{d})^2
$$



Take the derivative of $d$ , we have $f_t(d)=\frac{2m^2}{d^3}$ $\Rightarrow$ Power Law                            

Take the log, we have $\log(f(d))=\log(2m^2)-3\log(d)$   (Linear equation)          



###### Hybrid Model

Simple hybrid:  **First form fraction $\alpha$ links with the existing nodes, then form the other $1-\alpha$ fraction links by searching neighbourhoods of the existing friends**  (linked randomly before)    <font color="#dd0000">natural clusterings</font>                                  

In a network with half degree $k$ and half degree $2k$ individuals, randomly select a link and then a node on one end of it has $\frac{2}{3}$ chance that it has degree $2k$ and $\frac{1}{3}$ chance that it has degree $k$ , because nodes with $2k$ degree take the proportion of $\frac{2}{3}$ in all the $3k$ links                       

Steps:       

1. Randomly find a node               
2. Randomly pick one of the nodes it attached to (Chance of finding a node via this step is proportional to its degree, sth like preferential attachment)                   (1st order linear ode)   


$$
d_i(i)=m\qquad(\text{Starting condition})\\
\frac{dd_i(t)}{dt}=am\cdot\frac{1}{t}+(1-a)m\cdot\frac{d_i(t)}{2mt} \qquad (\text{New links gained per unit time})
$$


$\Rightarrow$ $d_i(t)=(m+\frac{2am}{1-a})(\frac{t}{i})^{\frac{1-a}{2}}-\frac{2am}{1-a}$                                

Nodes that have expected degree less than $d$ at time $t$ are $i>t (\frac{m+k}{d+k})^{\frac{2}{1-a}}$ , $k=\frac{2am}{1-a}$     


$$
F_t(d)=\frac{t-t (\frac{m+k}{d+k})^{\frac{2}{1-a}}}{t}=1-(\frac{m+k}{d+k})^{\frac{2}{1-a}}
$$


- $a$ near $1$ nearly exponential
- $a$ near $0$ nearly preferential

##### Fitting Hybrid Model

We estimate $m$ directly and we select $a$ to minimize distance between actual distribution and model’s distribution            



#### Block Model

Enrich ER model to allow for probabilities to depend on node characteristics, attributes              

Prob(blue,blue)=$\frac{\text{#links}}{\text{#blue}*(\text{#blue}-1)/2}$           (links formed within blue nodes is $(\text{#blue}-1)+(\text{#blue}-2)+\cdots+1$                              

Prob(blue,red)=$\frac{\text{#links}}{\text{#blue}\cdot \text{#red}}$      (each blue node can link to all the red nodes)            

We could use this sort of model to test for homophily                

#### Popular set of models: ERGMs and its variants: SERGMS/SUGMs

- flexible to introduce various local features and dependencies
- can be estimated statistically

##### ERGM/$p^*$ model

Probability of a network depends on number of links and number of triangles             


$$
\beta_L\text{#links(g)}+\beta_T\text{#triangles(g)}\\
\text{Pr(g)}\sim\exp[\beta_L L(g)+\beta_T T(g)]
$$


`Thm by Hammersly and Clifford:`                               

> Any network model can be expressed in the exponential family with counts of graph statistics



$p$ :probability of a link; $L(g)$ : number of links in $g$         


$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{Pr}[(\mathrm{g})] &=\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{L}(\mathrm{g})}(1-\mathrm{p})^{\mathrm{n}(\mathrm{n}-1) / 2-\mathrm{L}(\mathrm{g})} \\
&=[\mathrm{p} /(1-\mathrm{p})]^{\mathrm{L}(\mathrm{g})}(1-\mathrm{p})^{\mathrm{n}(\mathrm{n}-1) / 2} \\
&=\exp [\log (\mathrm{p} /(1-\mathrm{p})) \mathrm{L}(\mathrm{g})-\log (1 /(1-\mathrm{p})) \mathrm{n}(\mathrm{n}-1) / 2] \\
&=\exp \left[\quad \beta_{1} \quad \mathrm{s}_{1}(\mathrm{g})-\mathrm{c}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$


To be probability, $\operatorname{Pr}(\mathrm{g})=\frac{\exp \left[\beta_{\mathrm{L}} \mathrm{L}(\mathrm{g})+\beta_{\mathrm{T}} \mathrm{T}(\mathrm{g})\right]}{\sum_{\mathrm{g}^{\prime}} \exp \left[\beta_{\mathrm{L}} \mathrm{L}\left(\mathrm{g}^{\prime}\right)+\beta_{\mathrm{T}} T\left(\mathrm{g}^{\prime}\right)\right]}$

<img src="C:\Users\H.X.X\Documents\GitHub\XixuHu.GitHub.io\_posts\2020-07-20-金融经济网\shape.PNG" style="zoom:60%;" />




$$
\begin{array}{l}
\operatorname{Pr}(\mathrm{g})=\exp \left[\beta_{1} \# \text { links }+\beta_{2} \#\right.\text { two stars } \\
\left.\quad+\beta_{3} \# \text { three stars }+\beta_{4} \# \text { triangles }-\mathrm{c}\right]
\end{array}
$$


We use MCMC techniques for estimation, however, this method is not quite accurate            



##### SERGMs

Many network lead to the same statistics:

- Probabilities only depend on statistics
- Networks with the same statistics are “equivalent” (equally likely)

Define sufficient statistics $S(g)$ , $N(s')=$ the number of networks s.t. $S(g')=s'$           


$$
\operatorname{Pr}(g)=\frac{\exp [\beta\ \mathrm{S}(\mathrm{g})]}{\sum_{\mathrm{s}^{\prime}} \exp \left[\beta\ \mathrm{S}\left(\mathrm{g}^{\prime}\right)\right]}\Rightarrow \operatorname{Pr}(g)=\frac{\exp [\beta\ S(g)]}{\sum_{s^{\prime}} N\left(s^{\prime}\right) \exp \left[\beta\ s^{\prime}\right]}
$$


*“Collapse all equivalent networks”*                      

Instead of thinking about the prob of a network, we can start to think about the prob of a statistics——


$$
\operatorname{Pr}(s)=\frac{\mathrm{N}(\mathrm{s}) \exp [\beta\ \mathrm{s}]}{\sum_{s^{\prime}} N\left(s^{\prime}\right) \exp \left[\beta\ \mathrm{s}^{\prime}\right]}
$$


Statistics Form $\Rightarrow$ Work in a smaller space     (You can also change $N(s)$ to other $K(s)$ for more flexible networks)

$S$ can encode many things: links, cliques, k-stars, subgraphs, friends in common per links, multi-graphs, adapt for degree distributions                            



##### SUGMs

- Subgraph generation models
- Subgraphs are generated, network is by-product

*“People form links, triangles and some are isolated (anti-social)”*                

One problem: when the network is dense, there might be incidental triangles, which cause troubles to estimation, since the number of triangles that were directly generated needs to be estimated carefully. When network is sparse, we can estimate it efficiently.              

Nature forms subgraphs $S_j$ independently with probability $p_j$ . We observed the final resulting network and try to infer $p_j's$ .                          

Incidental triangles:



![](C:\Users\H.X.X\Documents\GitHub\XixuHu.GitHub.io\_posts\2020-07-20-金融经济网\SUGM.PNG)



View SUGMs as SERGMs: $S$ is the true counts of  subgraphs <u>(vector, not observed, need to infer)</u> , $p_j$ is the parameter for subgraph type $j$                            



​    
$$
\operatorname{Pr}(S)=\frac{\mathrm{K}(\mathrm{S}) \exp [\beta \mathrm{S}]}{\sum_{\mathrm{s}^{\prime}} \mathrm{K}\left(\mathrm{s}^{\prime}\right) \exp \left[\beta \mathrm{s}^{\prime}\right]}
$$
  

$\beta_{\mathrm{j}}=\log \left(p_{\mathrm{j}} /\left(1-p_{\mathrm{j}}\right)\right)$ and $\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{n}}(\mathrm{s})=\prod_{\mathrm{j}}\left(\begin{array}{c}
\bar{S}_{j}^{n} \\
s_{j}
\end{array}\right)$ (how many configurations you could form of having exactly a particular count $s_j$ ; how many ways could you get a certain number of triangles out of how many different triangles there were)           





















### Nestedness: 网络中的嵌套结构   

Nestedness: A hierarchical organization where the set of neighbors of a node is a subset (superset) of the neighbors of lower (larger) degree        

Stability: 

- Local stability: the ability of the system to return to its original equilibrium state after a small perturbation  
- Global stability: ...... after a perturbation of any magnitude         



Feasibility: the existence of equilibrium points such that all species are represented by at least one individual (crucial for co-existence species in ecology)               

### Socio-economic part

Ecological system $\longleftrightarrow$ Socio-ecnomic network: understand common robustness properties and design effective strategies to prevent catastrophic events         

#### Examples:

##### Country-level trade network

World- trade dataset: feature the volumes of exports of products between countries over multiple years          

There is a growing interest in the topology of the trade networks for specific products and industries. The trade networks of more sophisticated products are typically more centralized and nested than those of less complex products. While positive, the correlation between product complexity (determined by node importance metrics) and trade-network centralization is far from being perfect, which suggests that we should seek the help from complexity and nestedness.                    

Another way to look at World Trade data is to study the bipartite country–product network where countries are connected with the products they export. The nested structure of the country–product network has deep implications for economic theories: the most developed countries are highly diversified, having a comparative advantage over a large number of products, while developing countries are only competitive in the export of products that are also exported by highly-diversified developed countries. Country diversification is strongly correlated with the economic fitness of a country.            

##### Contractor network

Outsourced: a firm ‘‘outsources’’ a part of its internal activity to an external company       

Manufacturer/ designer: the firms that design and market products                       

Contractor: the firms that perform the necessary activities for the actual fabrication of the product
