Gradient descent intuition

Single parameter: $\theta_{1}:=\theta_{1}-\alpha \frac{d}{d \theta_{1}} J\left(\theta_{1}\right)$ 

If more than one parameters, one needs to update simultaneously



NP-complete

1. You can check the solution is correct in a polynomial time
2. Once you can solve one NP-complete problem, you can solve them all

*Implement the simplest thing you can imagine*

- *for example, a greedy solution*
- *see how well it does, inspect the solution*

*Relax - give quality guarantee*
